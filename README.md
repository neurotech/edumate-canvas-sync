# edumate-canvas-sync

:link: A Node.js application that synchronises multiple datasets from Edumate to Canvas on a schedule in a modular fashion.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

`edumate-canvas-sync` requires Docker version `>= 1.9` as it uses Docker's networking feature: [https://blog.docker.com/2015/11/docker-multi-host-networking-ga/](https://blog.docker.com/2015/11/docker-multi-host-networking-ga/)

`edumate-canvas-sync` uses the `rollbar-relay` to log it's events to [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/). This module requires the `ROLLBAR_POST_SERVER_ITEM_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable to be set. This token is listed in your [Rollbar](https://rollbar.com/) project's settings under *Project Access Tokens*.

`EDUMATE_PORT`                          | DB2 port i.e. `50001`
`EDUMATE_PATH`                          | DB2 suffix i.e. `ORGANISATION`
`EDUMATE_USERNAME`                      | DB2 username

## TODO

 - Commit SQL statements that formed the VIEWs that `datasets.js` references to repo
 - Add support for manually running specific datasets on-demand via HTTP request with optional Slack messaging support i.e.
   1. A request is received: `GET /sync/sub-accounts`
   - Run the appropriate dataset
   - Optionally return some sort of status message:
     - Get ID of the returned SIS Import
     - Poll `sis_imports/{id}` every `n` seconds
     - When status = completed, return success
     - When status = error, return error

## DONE

  - Added support for logging events to Rollbar.
